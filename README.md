## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a lightweight yet accurate KWS model capable of running seamlessly on the Monocle AR device. Keyword Spotting allows the device to recognize specific spoken keywords or commands, enhancing user interaction and control.

## Features

- TensorFlow Lite Micro Integration: Utilizes TensorFlow Lite Micro to optimize the KWS model for execution on resource-constrained microcontrollers.
- Low-Powered MCU Support: Tailored for efficient operation on the Monocle AR device, maximizing performance on limited hardware resources.
- Keyword Recognition: Enables the Monocle AR device to identify and respond to predefined keywords, enhancing user engagement and functionality.
